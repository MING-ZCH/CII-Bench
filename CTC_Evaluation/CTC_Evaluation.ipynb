It can not only accurately interpret traditional cultural elements, but also reveal their deep meaning. It has unique insights into the aesthetic characteristics and skills of the image. It deeply expounds on the relevant historical and cultural background, and can see through the philosophical thoughts, humanistic spirit or social values contained in the image, showing a deep understanding of Chinese traditional culture.\n",
